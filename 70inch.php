    <h1>70" Big Pads</h1>
    <p>There are currently 4 different models of 70" screens, the PN-70TB3, PN-70SC5, PN-70TW3A and the PN-70TH5. There is one major difference for one of these models, the PN-70TH5 features a 4k screen (3840x2160) instead of 1920x1080, so if you need the best picture quality possible then you should look into the 4k version.<br>
      There are slight differences between the other three models, for example the PN-70SC5 was designed for education and office meeting rooms, so it includes a freeze frame and blackout buttons as well as two built in 10W speakers which are more than loud enough to fill large classrooms Whereas, the PN-70TW3A seems to be for a hospital or medical facility, with DICOM emulation for radiology reciewings as one of it's key selling features. The PN-70TB3 is designed for an office meeting room so there is no need for such features as the blackout button or radiological review software to be included. </p>

    <h2>PN-70SC5</h2>
    <p>The main difference of the PN-70SC5 compared to the other models of the 70" models is that it features the Freeze-frame and Blackout buttons, which adds wanted features for teachers because it gives them greater control over what is being shown on the screen, so they can leave work on the screen while they can get on with other work in the background.</p>
