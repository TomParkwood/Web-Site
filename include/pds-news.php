$newsBody[1] = "<p>Following a recent investigation from CBS news which found that many copiers are sold into the second hand market with hard drives full of confidential or sensitive personal data still in them, Sharp has a solution which will avoid the new high level fines which could be imposed by the UK&#39;s ICO.</p><p>The investigation found hard drives within MFP&#39;s (Multi-function Printers and Copier) containing sensitive and personal data. The machines in question were selling for only a few hundred dollars and often headed overseas to unknown customers, all within a few days of being removed from their original installation. With fines from the UK ICO potentially heading up to the 500,000 mark this is one liability UK companies could do without. Yet most MFP users do not know that MFP&#39;s store images on their Hard drives. A Sharp USA survey in 2008 found that 60% of customers are unaware of this feature of their office digital copier.</p><p>Sharp was one of the first companies in this area and continues to provide market leading data erasure and data privacy (encryption) facilities on their MFP&#39;s. The Common Criteria certified security add-on for Sharp Machines is typically less than 5% of the RRP of the machine.</p><p>&quot;Our Data Security Kit (DSK) can ensure that Copying and Scanning actions are automatically and securely erased as soon as the job has completed&quot; said Chris Hale, Sharp UK&#39;s Document Solutions Product Marketing Manager. &quot;We have been advising customers that fitting the DSK is becoming an essential option for many businesses&quot;.</p><p>Watch the CBS News video:<a href=\"http://www.cbsnews.com/video/watch/?id=6412572n&amp;tag=contentBody;featuredPost-PE\" target=\"_blank\">here</a></p><p>If you have any questions or concerns about the issues raised here then please <a href=\"contact.php\">contact us</a></p>";

That person basically re-signs a contract, so they end up putting interest on interest. They can end up paying for five or 10 years and cannot get the costs to come down because the interest is so high.&quot;</p><p>In September last 2009, a leaked report by former WH Smith chief executive Richard Handover laid bare the full extent of money being wasted in schools.</p><P>Mr Balls had commissioned the report to pinpoint areas where schools could save money, but was forced to distance himself from the findings after the BBC said schools were wasting millions.</P><p>The Handover report said one primary school had spent 50,000 on installing three toilets - five times the proposed sum - while another school spent 30,000 on a photocopier.</p><P>It led to Mr Handover claiming that headteachers had &quot;no concept of the value of money&quot;.</P><p>Mick Brookes, general secretary of heads&#39; union the NAHT, said his union was &quot;very concerned&quot; about the growing responsibilities that heads are now expected to take on.</p><P>&quot;This just shows that we need to get school business directors and school business managers in place to take away from heads these types of tasks,&quot; he said. &quot;This is not what heads should be doing. What they should be doing is leading teaching and learning. They are not businessmen.&quot;</P><p><b>Our Thoughts Here At ParkWood</b></p><p><i>All that glitters may not be Gold!</i></p><p><i>If a salesman tells you that a deal &quot;is too good to be true&quot; and that you would be a fool to miss out then shouldn&#39;t you take great care over your decisions? Very rarely is it a good decision to terminate a Finance Lease early. If the machine is wrong for your requirements and/or you are unhappy with your current supplier then there may be a case for changing however; certainly don&#39;t change early just because your current supplier wants you to. That is definitely going to cost you money and put more unjustified profit in their pockets! Profit is good for everyone; all companies need to make it BUT honesty, ethics and excellent customer service are a paramount pre-requisite for our industry.</i></p><p><i>Talk to an Independent who will tell you the situation &quot;warts and all&quot;! </i></p><p><i>Our advice is based on you getting the right information, the right equipment and support, all at the right price. We don&#39;t need to tie you in to long service contracts, if we are good you will stay with us. If we are not then you are free to move your business elsewhere. </i></p><p><i>Time to move to a PROFESSIONAL and INDEPENDENT company who put the client FIRST!</i></p>";
