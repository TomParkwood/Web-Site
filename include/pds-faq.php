$faqQuestion[0] = "Why do I have black (or white) lines on my copies?";
$faqAnswer[0] = "<p>If copying from the document feeder this is probably due to marks on the 'split glass' (thin strip of glass to the side of main glass).<br>
To confirm this try copying something from the main glass, if the lines disappear then there will be marks on the split glass.<br>
Clean the slit glass with a damp cloth.</p>";

$faqQuestion[1] = "Why wont my machine switch on?";
$faqAnswer[1] = "<p>Most copiers especially Sharp's have two on/off switches.<br>
Please check the back of the copier near where the mains power lead is plugged in or inside the main front door of the copier.</p>";

$faqQuestion[2] = "Where can I find a driver for my device?";
$faqAnswer[2] = "<p>When ParkWood Document Solutions supplys a machine, we try to always provide a cd or USB stick with the drivers for your device.<br>
It is important to download and install the manufacturers drivers, this is because the Windows generic drivers are basic and often hamper the functionability of the printer.<br>
Here are some links to our machine ranges.<br>
We recommend that you use the PCL6 driver version if it is available and not to opt for the universal driver.<br>
For some older machines it maybe useful to know that most Windows 7 drivers will also work with Windows 10.<br>

$faqQuestion[5] = "How can I connect my device to my PC?";
$faqAnswer[5] = "<p>For most modern devices there are two options.<br>
Option 1: Via a USB cable directly into your PC<br>
Option 2: Via a network cable. The network cable is plugged into a free network port. The device and PC would then need to be configured for network printing.<br>
Setup for the network option differs depending on manufacturer and device. If you require help networking your device please <a href=\"contact.php\">Contact Us</a> for more information.</p>";

$faqQuestion[6] = "Why is my device not printing?";
$faqAnswer[6] = "<p>Are you trying to set the device for the first time - if so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Do you have the correct driver for your machine? (Use PCL)</li>
  <li>Has the network details been entered correctly and has the correct network port on your machine?</li>
  <li>Do you have user codes set up on the device? If so make sure you have entered the correct code for the user when you select the job to print. You can check the user code under the driver settings on the PC the job was sent from.</li>
</ul>
<p>Has the printing worked in the past - if so:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Try turning the machine off/on again at the mains to reboot it.</li>
  <li>Check on computer (or server) to see if any jobs are stuck in the print queue - and cancel</li>
  <li>Confrim that the machine still has a network connection ( network cable is plugged in? - check lights are on )</li>
  <li>If you have User codes activated on your copier - check that this is still in your driver or that your limits have not been reached</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are still unable to print, please do not hesitate to <a href=\"contact.php\">Contact Us</a> and we will help you in any way that we can.</p> ";

$faqQuestion[7] = "Why does the copier keep saying out of paper when there is paper in the trays?";
$faqAnswer[7] = "<p>If the machine does not have paper in the trays matching what has been requested by the print command it will show out of paper message<br>
Check the page setingst of the document you are trying to print and change if necessary (eg may be non-standard size). If using non standard size or heavy paper you may have to select the bypass tray as the paper input feed. place the special media in the bypass tray and print the document with the bypass try selected as the paper feed.. </p>";
$faqType[7] = 2;

$faqQuestion[8] = "Why does my Ricoh machine keep asking for sender email address when scanning to email?";
$faqAnswer[8] = "<p>This is because 'Auto Specify Sender's Name' is disabled or off in the 'File Transfer' options.<br>
1.  Before enabling Auto Specify Sender's Name feature, check to ensure there is a Key Operator's E-mail address entered in the MFP. To check and/or enter one, follow this click path at the op panel: User Tools > Systems Settings > File Transfer > Administrator E-mail Address.<br>
2.  To enable Auto Specify Sender's Name, follow this click path: User Tools > System Settings > File Transfer > Auto Specify Sender's Name (Choose On).</p>";

$faqQuestion[9] = "Can I use recycled paper in my machine?";
$faqAnswer[9] = "<p>We recommend that you do not.<br>
Recycled paper is good for making cardboard boxes and those cup holders you find in coffee shops. It is also of a lower quality than other papeprs. Do not use it in your photocopier!<br>
Recycled paper has to be washed, mashed, pressed and dried. Unknown to most recycled paper holds a lot more moisture and dust than normal paper. As the machine heats up after prolonged use the moisture and dust in the paper starts to come out and the paper starts to curl causing it to get stuck in the machine's workings, causing paper jams.<br>
Saying this, most copiers will cope with up to 50% recycled paper for short print runs. </p>";
$faqType[9] = 1;

$faqQuestion[10] = "Lines on my prints and copies from my Sharp copier";
$faqAnswer[10] = "<p>Sometimes lines may appear on your Sharp copier, this can be caused by a number of things.<br>
The first thing to check, is it only on copy mode?<br>
Then, is it only when you use the document feeder?<br>
If this is the case then there will be a small mark on the document feeder target glass (The thin strip of glass to the left of the main glass). Give this a good clean and you should be back in business.</p>
<p>If it is on both copy and printing, then the lines are being caused by a small bit of toner being stuck to the main charge unit.<br>
Although this may sound complicated it is really eas to fix, and you will be getting nice clean prints again in minutes.</p>
<p>You will need to open the front door, and remove the waste toner container. You will then see a green rod attached inside the front door.<br>
Remove this and insert it into the hole next to each of the four black plastic protuding items. Once you have inserted and removed into each of the four holes, replace the waste toner and put the green rod back into its holder, and carry on printing.<br>
If this doesn't cure the lines, then please log a call out and we will come and sort it for you.</p>";

$faqQuestion[11] = "Poor print or missing colours on Oki printers";
$faqAnswer[11] = "<p>We have found a common problem with a lot of Oki printers, which use the LED print system. Sometimes the mono print will almost disappear or become somewhat hieroglyphic, we have also seen the colours either becoming offset to each other or completely vanishing.</p>
<ol>
  <li><span style=font-size:14pt;><strong>Turn the machine off and remove the power lead!</span></strong></li>
  <li>Open the cover whch shows the drums and toners.</li>
  <li>Look under the open cover and you will see four black led strips.</li>
  <li>Note the ribbon cable on the right hand side going into these bars.</li>
  <li>Carefully pull the ribbon cable from the led bar.</li>
  <li>Reinsert the cable back into the bar, checking that it is seated securely.</li>
  <li>Restart the machine and test.</li>

<p>If this doesn't cure the problem, then please log a call out and we will come and sort it out for you.</p>";

$faqQuestion[12] = "Setting up shared folders";
$faqAnswer[12] = "<p>You want to be able to scan to a folder or give access to files to other people on the network, you will need to setup a shared folder. This is actually a lot easier than it sounds.<br>
We recommend creating a new folder on your desktop or another folder where you will remember where it is.<br>
You can do this by right clicking on the desktop and hover the mouse over new, then click folder. Give the new folder a sensible name such a Scans.<br>
Right click on the folder which you wish to share, and select properties. Under the tabs at the top select Sharing, then click the Share... button.<br>
In the textbox enter everyone and then click Add. Under Permission Level click on everyone and then change it to Read/Write then click Share. It will open a screen which should say Your folder is shared, you can click Done.<br>
Still under the Sharing tab, click Advanced Sharing..., then there is a button which says Share this folder, select that. Then click Permissions make sure that Everyone is highlighted then on the Permissions, change it to Full Control. You can then click Apply and Ok on the Advanced Sharing menu.<br>
Back on the folder's properties in Sharing there will be a Network Path:, make a note of this including the \\ becasuse this is the folder you will enter when setting up a Scan to Folder account.</p>";
$faqType[12] = 0;

$faqQuestion[13] = "Scan to folder isn't working";
$faqAnswer[13] = "<p>Unfortunately there isn't one answer to this question it could be a range of problems.<br>
It could be that the information is entered wrong on the copier, or it could be that a password has been changed on the computer or it could even be that there is a problem within the network.<br>
One of the solutions could be that your network settings for your machine are incorrect, this would mean that you cannot see this computer on the network from another device.
If you have an IT department please don't change this without their permission
Windows 7:<br>
Control Panel- Network and Internet- Network and Sharing Centre.<br>
Here it will show the network that you are connected to. It will show the name of the network then either Public, Work or Home network.<br>
If the network is set to public it will not show the network for any other devices on the network to connect to it, thus blocking the scans from getting to the folder.<br>
So change this to am appropriate one other than public, then check that it is working. You can also check that you can see other devices on the network by, opening up My Computer, then on the left click Network, this will show all of the devices on the network as well as the copier.<br>
<br>
Windows 10:<br>
One way to change this on Windows 10 is to open the settings menu from the start menu. Then click on Network & Internet.<br>
If you connect to the internet wirelessly select Wi-Fi or if you use an ethernet cable select ethernet.<br>
Click on the connection name which is followed by connected. At the top there should be a switch will says Public and Private click on Private, this should allow for other devices on the network to find your computer. To test, go to This PC and on the left click Network, it should show all the devices on the network as well as the copier, you could also try sending a scan to the folder and see if it gets through.</p>";

$faqQuestion[14] = "Lock down paper trays";
$faqAnswer[14] = "<p>Unfortunately this isn't the same for every machine and it will vary from brand to brand.<br>
Sharp MFP:<br>
At the machine go into Settings, then Tray Settings, click on the tray which you wish to lock off. Change the paper type to the most appropriate such as letterhead or thick paper. Then turn off auto tray switching, this is so that if the machine runs out of paper in another tray of the same size it will not take the paper from this tray.<br>
On the computer go to Control Panel, then devices and then select printer. Right click on it and select Printer Properties (not just Properties), then under General tab click Preferences, then click Paper up the top, on the picture of the machine click the paper tray which you wish to lock off and change the paper type and click apply.<br>
<br>
Ricoh MFP:<br>
Please note we have only tested this on a Ricoh MP C306Z<br>
This is done on the printer driver, so go into control panel then devices, then printers and select the printer.<br>
Right click on it and then select Printer Properties (not just Properties). Then under General click Preferences, then under detailed settings select Paper, then on Input Tray select the tray which you wish to change, then Paper Type select the most appropriate one and click apply.<br>
Just as a precaution go back to Frequently Used Settings for Normal Print and change input tray to the appropriate one, e.g. not the one you have just setup for letterhead or other types of paper.</p>";

$faqQuestion[15] ="Questions to ask before you get a photocopier";
$faqAnswer[15] = "<p>Speed: How fast is the photocopier going to be?<br>
Your monthly print volume will dictate the output speed of any device. The higher the volume then the quicker the engine speed, don't be pressured into buying a fast machine for low volume output, you'll just be wasting your money.<br>
Each machine has a manufacturers recommended monthly output volume, once we know what your current, and future anticipated volumes are, we will be in a position to recommend the most appropriate machines for your needs.</p>
<br>
<p>Capability: What can our machine do?<br>
