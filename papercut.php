    <p>PaperCut is probably the most well known print management solution which exists. With features which offer functionality and customisation options to make PaperCut the right solution for you.</p>
    <p>Make managing your printers much easier and centralised, so no matter what combinations of models and brands you have they will be supported in one way or another.<br>
      With PaperCut being able to be placed onto Windows, Linux and even Novell servers, you aren't being forced to learn a new system just for PaperCut.<br>
      With the option to embed PaperCut onto your MFDs which drastically improves how you manage your printing and abilities to track all functionality of the machines, not just how much has been printed, but also copying, scanning and faxing.</p>
    <p>If you keep wondering why you are paying so much for your printing, whether that be going over your print contracts or buying lots of toner, PaperCut allows you to run customised reports on basically anything. Want to see who prints the most out of the Accounts team, want to see who always prints in single sided colour, want to find out if only 10 pages come out of one printer every month. You can do so, as well as running the reports manually they can be set to automatically run, and emailed out to the correct people in multiple different formats so you can fit in with your existing reporting if necessary.</p>
    <p>PaperCut makes setting up new users as easy as possible, by syncing with Active Directory and updating every night, which means that once you have added the user onto the Active Directory and placed them into a group they will automatically gain the print privileges assigned to that group. No more having to assign rights individually or for everyone, it can be seperated into groups with manual overrides for certain users if needed.<br>
      Being able to walk up to any printer on the network and print off your print queue is something which either sounds interesting or useless at the beginning, but after using it for a period of time you will never want to go back, as it offers so much flexibility and ease of use. No more having to send your print jobs to a specific printer just press print and walk up to any printer. Working in a different city tomorrow just login at the machine and your prints will come out. No more having to resend your prints when the printer is down for maintenance, just go to the next closest one. One of the main benefits is that you don't have to worry about printing off any confidential documents anymore, because it won't print out until you login at the printer, so the documents aren't left at the exit tray for anybody to pick up, they will only be there once you have logged in and selected to print them off.</p>
    <p>One of the best features of PaperCut is that it isn't brand specific, so it will work on almost every single printer that can be connected to a network, not just the huge A3 MFDs.</p>
    <h3>Did you know that there is two main versions of PaperCut?</h3>
    <p>There is currently two different versions of PaperCut which are offered, which are targeted to different needs of organisations.<br>
      The simple version is PaperCut NG, which monitors and assigns costs to what is being printed. This is useful where you want control over how much users can print and assigning rules on how print jobs are printed, such as only printing black &amp; white as default and displaying a message when they try to print in colour.<br>
      The more advanced version of PaperCut is PaperCut MF, which has all of the features of NG but also enables a small application to be embedded within the photocopiers for greater control, over who has access to these devices.<br>
      Whereas PaperCut NG can only track the print jobs which have been sent to the print queue, PaperCut MF is able to track and monitor everything that is done on the machine once the user has logged in, this is copying, scanning and printing.<br>
      With having PaperCut embedded onto the photocopier you need to login everytime you want to use it, now this would be a pain if you had to enter a username and password each time, luckily there are many different methods of logging on, these include pin codes, ID cards and biometric scanners. PaperCut has said themselves that they want to support as many different authentication methods as possible to make it easier for you.<br>
      One of the most important things about PaperCut is that it isn't brand specific, not even when you embed it into a machine, so you can have a mix match of brands all with PaperCut embedded. Although it may not fully support all functions of every machine and will be harder to setup and configure to begin with.</p>
    <h3>Are your printing costs spiraling out of control?</h3>
    <p>PaperCut offers the ability to track who is printing, this could be departments, individual users, or by printer. You can assign print costs based on the printers consumables and easily be able to charge it to individuals or departments.<br>
      Did you know that PaperCut also offers an upgrade which makes it much easier to charge customers so you can recoup printing costs for their printing, this can be especially helpful for law firms and architecture.</p>
    <h3>Do you think that you print too much and it is being wasted?</h3>
    <p>Being able to keep an archive of all print jobs on the server, this shows what the document type is, the name of the document and for some file types a preview of what was printed.<br>
      This will show you if an employee who only ever works on spreadsheets is printing lots of personal pictures, so you can then raise the question.<br>
      As well as the standard features and reports that can be run on PaperCut there is also scripting, which allows for much more customisation of what can be done, one of the sample scripts is to bring up a warning message when prints are done single sided, reminding employees that it is cheaper to print douple sided, or to print to a cheaper machine. You can assign limits for how much people can print each month, this would be helpful if you believe that certain users are printing out much more than they need to, if they run out of credit they will have to speak to an admin to get more.<br>
      If you don't like the idea of assigning a monetary value to the printing, you can easily change it to whole numbers and get rid of the currency and just deduct whole numbers. In practice this would be giving a user 2000 credits every month and every A4 sheet decrements 1 and every A3 sheet decrements 2, instead of 3p or 6p for example.</p>
    <h3>Printing flexibility</h3>
    <p>One of the main features of PaperCut is that it allows for Follow Me printing, where the print job will sit on a secure server until it has been requested by a machine, then it will print out.<br>
      This can also be done across multiple different locations as long as the right hardware is in place, so if you have an office in London and Southampton, you can send a job to print at your desk in London and then collect from a printer in Southampton.</p>
    <h3>Bring your own device printing?</h3>
    <p>PaperCut offers lots of flexibility in how print jobs are sent to the queue. Did you know that there is an app for phones which allow you to upload a document to print to your queue?<br>
      If you are using Google Docs for the majority of your work don't worry because PaperCut also fully supports Google Cloud Print.<br>
      As well as Email to Print, so you can simply send out an email to the address with instructions on how you want it to be printed and an attachment to print, then when you login at the machine the print will be waiting for you.<br>
      PaperCut also offers what it calls Mobility Printing, which is an easy way of ensuring that pretty much any device you could want to print from can. There are no drivers to install for the users and allows printing from pretty much any application.
