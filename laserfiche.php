    <h3>What is Laserfiche?</h3>
    <p>Laserfiche allows companies to properly manage their documents in easy to find places and also makes it easier to digitize all paper based documents.<br>
      Laserfiche allows for much better searching of documents with more defined queries, so you are more likely to find what you are looking for on the first go instead of having to try multiple searches and still not finding anything.<br>
      By having a centralised copy of all documents, you can reduce document duplication across your network, so you will always know what the most recent version of documents are and where they are stored.<br>
      OCR (Optical Character Recognition) for scanned files, get the information you need from your paper records automatically without having to get it entered in manually.</p>
    <h3>What are the benefits of having Laserfiche?</h3>
    <p>Laserfiche allows you to save time and thus money on trying to find where users have saved their documents when someone else goes to work on them.<br>
      Laserfiche gives you the ability to apply notes and other annotations to docments, so it allows for better workflows between different users, so you always know what the latest notes and requirements are.<br>
      If you want to make certain documents hidden to all but certain pieces of information need to be given to people to do their work. Laserfiche offers the ability to redact text from documents so it can be kept away from unwanted eyes.<br>
      Quickly get forms back, with digitally approved forms, which can then be automatically routed to the person who needs to accept or deny, let them decide only, then have the answer routed back to the sender automatically. This is all done without having to print out anything, wait for them to find the piece of paper, fill it out then for it to make its way back to the sender.<br>
      Task lists which lets users know what they need to do and a proper due by date, so they can't put it off any longer and that it needs to be done.</p>
    <h3>Features of Laserfiche.</h3>
    <p>Laserfiche allows you to have a web portal which can enable you to make certain documents available to the public, which could save money on marketing costs.<br>
      You can also automate documents to go to the right people when they would need them, so it saves on waiting for documents to be sent to the person and trying to find the documents on desks or computers. This is helpful for constant workflows such as when someone has finished a document it needs to be checked and signed off before it can be sent out, this would wait until the document is finished then send it to the manager, then to the person who is responsible for sending it out.<br>
      Laserfiche offers the same functionality as OneDrive and other cloud storage solutions, where when the internet goes down and can no longer sync the files to the latest versions, it will save a local copy and then update as soon as its back online.<br>
      Make batch scanning much simpler with intuitive user interfaces which makes it much easier to process documents.</p>
    <h3>How can you use Laserfiche?</h3>
    <p>Laserfiche allows you to save directly to it from Microsoft Office. This also includes importing emails (with their attachments) with only a few clicks.<br>
      If you have employees who are rarely in the office but still need to upload files and get files from the centre hub, they can do so with mobile devices.</p>
