          <td style="width: 40%;">Ok so it isn't a photocopier, but our Sharp partners have released a 40" Interactive Nursery Table.<br>
            The amazing feature of this table is the battery. You are not restricted to the wall plug. This can be rolled to the position you want.<br>
            There is also another version which is being worked on at the moment which includes height adjustment as well as screen rotation, so it is better suited for adult use.<br>
            One of the areas which could benefit from a large interactive tablet is care providers, not just for toddlers, but providing dementia patients with interactive games to help stimulate their brains.
