    <h1>60" Big Pads</h1>
    <p>The 60" range of Big Pads currently has three models the PN-60SC5, the PN-60TB3 and the PN-TW3A. The different models are aimed at different scenarios for where they will be the best suited, so they all have slightly different features and functions built in.<br>
      For example the PN-60SC5 was designed for education and office meeting rooms, because it features freeze frame and blackout buttons which allows the presenter to have complete control over the screen. Whereas the PN-60TW3A was designed for hospitals and office meeting rooms, so it has DICOM emulation mode which is used when reviewing radiological scans and the PN-60TB3 which doesn't feature either of these functions.</p>
    <h2>PN-60SC5</h2>
    <p>Has been designed specifically with education and office meeting rooms in mind, with its 'Pen-on-Paper' user experience which gives you a more accurate touchscreen writing and input sensation.</p>

    <h2>PN-60TB3</h2>
    <p>Although the PN-60TB3 is the more basic model of 60" screen currently offered, it doesn't have worse quality or a bad screen. The screen itself is the same touch screen as the other two models, it just doesn't have the added features such as the blackout buttons or DICOM emulation. So for most offices and meeting areas this model is ideal because it has the functionality that you need without the added extras that more than likely will not be used.</p>
