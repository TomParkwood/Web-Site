    <h3>General Information</h3>
     <table style="width:100%;">
       <tr>
         <td style = "width:75%;">The MX-2630N is ideal for any busy workgroup that needs a high performance, high quality colour and versatility. Offering a variety of innovative and producivity enhancing features including an intuitive user interface, a standard "Print Release" pull printing solution, high level security features as well as a range of connectivity options including cloud and mobile.<br>
            The standard Print Release function enables users to send and store documents in the main MFP, which acts as a server, allowing print jobs to be securely released at up to five networed devices. Optional workflow enhancing features include Single Sign-On cloud connectivity, mobile connectivity via Wi-Fi and NFC, and USB direct printing of MS Office files.<br>
            The standard 7" multi-touch colour LCD control panel provides the ability to drag and drop frequently used icons for simple customisation of the home screen. Everyday operation is simple and intuitive; just touch, tap, pinch and spread or swipe for instant access to every feature, function and setting including an advanced preview feature.<br>
            Print and copy speeds of up to 26 ppm in colour and black &amp; white, a built-in 100-sheet Reversing Feeder and a scan speed of up to 80 ipm all help to boost efficiency and productivity; while 600 x 600 dpi print resolution, our auto process control and developer refresh system ensure consistently high image quality. A maximum paper capacity of 6,300 sheets and support for a wide range of media (up to SRA3 and 300 gsm) enables this device to handle varied output requirements with ease. Plus, a variety of finishing options such as saddle stitching, manual and stapleless stapling add further versatility.<br>
            The MX-2630N has layer upon layer of robust but unobtrusive security, with TSL/ISL, IPsec and network protocol filtering. Other standard security features include secure erasure, strong encryption and administrator password protection. Plus, S/MIME for encrypting emails and digitally signing them. For even greater security the optional Data Security Kit (DSK) gives your customers a full suite of high security features including the Document Control feature, and the advanced DSK mode which enables an even higher protection profile.<br>
            The Energy Star-certified MX-2630N uses Sharp's latest energy-saving technology. Our low melt toner and quick-heating fuser unit reduce power consumption and you can configure automatic power on/off settings for further savings. In addition, the automatic toner cartridge eject function ensures all toner has been consumed, thereby saving resources.</td>
