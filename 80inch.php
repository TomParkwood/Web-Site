    <h1>80" Big Pads</h1>
    <p>The 80" range of Big Pads are currently the largest offered. There are three different models currently offered, the PN-80SC5, the PN-80TC3A and the PN-80TH5, they are markted towards different markets so they have different features, for example the PN-80SC5 is marketed towards education. Therefore it features better control over the screen, with blackout and freeze-frame buttons built into the screen, so that the teacher can easily control what is being shown on the screen, as well as allowing them to place work on the screen and carry on with other work at the same time. Whereas the PN-80TH5 is designed for specialised professional and mission critical applications, with its 4k resolution (3840 x 2160)</p>
