    <h1>What is a Big Pad?</h1>
    <p>If you've ever been in a classroom or attended a business meeting, you'll be familiar with the whiteboard - sometimes little more than a mirror image of the old-fashioned blackboard.<br>
      Things have come a long way since then, of course. Thanks to modern technology, the whiteboard converted to a large computer screen and, connected to a PC, laptop or projector, became interactive.<br>
      But developement has not stopped there. Several years ago now, the electronics company Sharp created the Big Pad - significantly expanding the interactive capabilities and quality of the whiteboard, so that it behaved just like a giant tablet or smartphone hung on the wall.<br>
      Big Pads are large interactive touchscreens, which can be wirelessly connected to the internet and are capable of being connected to other devices - from PCs to laptops, or even smartphones and tablets.<br>
      Providing the ultimate in interactive solutions, the big pad may provide the focus for a whole classroom of students, with up to 50 wirelessly connected devices, delivering a truly collaborative experience.<br>
      The present generation of school children - familiar with tablets and smartphones- the Big Pad and the technology associated with it already appears like a second home. But with these new interactive display products, they can all be linked with what is being shown to the class. They are gven a chance to engage with everyone in the room, by projecting whatever they draw, write or wish to present on the large touchscreen at the front of the room.<br>
      With access to their own images, videos, text and sound, the interactive whiteboard is immediately familiar, user-friendly and easy to use. It gives full rein to the creativity and imagination of every participant - whether in the classroom or boardroom.</p>
    <p>The Big Pad may be the last word in interconnectivity, but it is also entirely self-contained - everything you need, hanging on the wall at the front of the class.<br>
      It does not need to be connected to any other device - such as a PC, laptop or projector used in the past - but may be used entirely independantly.<br>
      The image remains crisp and sharp - and does not fade - over a life expectancy of a massive 50,000 hours of use. And since it consumes so little energy, it is cheap to run, too.<br>
      User-friendliness allows everyone to participate. Content is not limited to whatever is beamed from a projector - the projector may become largely redundant when so many other interactive devices may be wirelessly connected to the giant scren at the front of the room.<br>
      Having taken so easily to the interactive solutions afforded by the Big Pad, your class is more likely to want to recap or to move on from where they left off in the last lesson.<br>
      Keeping the record of past collaborative efforts is simply done by just wirelessly recording the work from the Big Pad or saving it to a USB stick - and bringing it up again the next lesson and you can all resume from exactly where you left off. If you need a hard copy from any key parts of the lesson, these can be just as easily printed off through a networked printer.</p>
      <p>With all screens boasting touch screen with fast and responsive Infrared (IR) 10<sup>1</sup> point touch which means that up to four users can be interacting with one screen at a time. As well as High Definition 1080p displays <sup>2</sup>. With more models being announced with 4k resolutions and up to 30 point multi-touch</p>
